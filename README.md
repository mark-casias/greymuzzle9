## Composer-enabled Drupal template

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for forking new Drupal upstreams
that work with the Platform's Integrated Composer build process. It is also the
Platform's standard Drupal 9 upstream.

Unlike with earlier Pantheon upstreams, files such as Drupal Core that you are
unlikely to adjust while building sites are not in the main branch of the
repository. Instead, they are referenced as dependencies that are installed by
Composer.

For more information and detailed installation guides, please visit the
Integrated Composer Pantheon [documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/integrated-composer)

## Theme

This is a reproduction of the current theme available at [our current site](https://www.greymuzzle.org). It is in progress. Currently the theme is extending the Olivero theme, but I am quickly finding this does not work. I am looking to use:

- TailwindCSS
- Patternlab

Of course, I may not get what I want. Feel free to fork and merge request any suggestions.

## @todo

- Finish Patternlab conversion
- Refresh DB with lates import
