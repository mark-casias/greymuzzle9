  body: "<p>Daisy was a dog who was abused up until she was adopted by my sister at the age of 7. The shelter said that was senior for her breed and to prepare to only have her for a year or two as she would most likely pass soon. She went on to live until the age of 15 and passed peacefully in the vet's office with everyone she loved right next to her. She may have bit everyone who tried to pet her but deep down she loved everyone she met! She is resting peacefully now knowing she had the most wonderful second half of her life she could have ever received. You will be missed sweet girl!</p>"
