body: '<p>When senior dogs enter shelters, their future is uncertain. The adoption rate for senior dogs (7 years or older) is lower than that of all other ages combined: Just over 50% find new homes. The Grey Muzzle Organization is one of the only national organizations dedicated specifically to advancing lifesaving efforts on behalf of senior dogs. We&nbsp;provide funding and resources to animal shelters and rescues groups nationwide.</p><p>Your love for senior dogs makes Grey Muzzles work possible. Because of your generosity, in 2020 more than 2500 senior dogs got the second chance they all deserve. Please help us serve even more senior dogs in 2021!
